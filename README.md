# VIRTUAL LAB 

A virtual lab designed in Python/Django, HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT, efficently showing the working of the flow control statements of FOR, WHILE and DO-WHILE loops to solve two problems with the complete dry run showing the value of each variable after each iteration on the side.

# Requirements:
  Python2.7
  Django 1.10

Just execute the command 'python manage.py runserver' in the terminal from inside the 'fossee' folder, and enter localhost:8000 in the browser.
And enjoy the virtual Lab.
